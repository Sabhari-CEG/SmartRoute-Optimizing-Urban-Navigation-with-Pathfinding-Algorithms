# SmartRoute-Optimizing-Urban-Navigation-with-Pathfinding-Algorithms
Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Uniform Cost Search (UCS), and A* Search. This project demonstrates the efficiency and effectiveness of these algorithms in finding optimal routes between cities, considering factors such as distance and time.
